This module provides support for the "CONNECT" HTTP method.  
This method is mainly used to [tunnel SSL requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling) through proxy servers.

Example
=======

```
 server {
     listen                         3128;

     # dns resolver used by forward proxying
     resolver                       8.8.8.8;

     # forward proxy for CONNECT request
     proxy_connect;
     proxy_connect_allow            443 563;
     proxy_connect_connect_timeout  10s;
     proxy_connect_read_timeout     10s;
     proxy_connect_send_timeout     10s;

     # forward proxy for non-CONNECT request
     location / {
         proxy_pass http://$host;
         proxy_set_header Host $host;
     }
 }
```

With above configuration, you can get any https website via HTTP CONNECT tunnel.
A simple test with command `curl` is as following:

```
$ curl https://github.com/ -v -x 127.0.0.1:3128
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...                                           -.

```

The sequence diagram of above example is as following:

```
  curl                     nginx (proxy_connect)            github.com

Also you can configure your browser to use this nginx as PROXY server (e.g. Google Chrome HTTP PROXY SETTING).

Here is another [guide & config](https://github.com/chobits/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module/issues/22#issuecomment-346941271) for how to configure this module working under SSL layer (for supporing Google Chrome HTTPS PROXY SETTING).

Install
=======

* Select right patch for building:

| nginx version | enable REWRITE phase | patch |
| --: | --: | --: |
| 1.4.x ~ 1.12.x  | NO  | [proxy_connect.patch](patch/proxy_connect.patch) |
| 1.4.x ~ 1.12.x  | YES | [proxy_connect_rewrite.patch](patch/proxy_connect_rewrite.patch) |
| 1.13.x ~ 1.14.x | NO  | [proxy_connect_1014.patch](patch/proxy_connect_1014.patch) |
| 1.13.x ~ 1.14.x | YES | [proxy_connect_rewrite_1014.patch](patch/proxy_connect_rewrite_1014.patch) |
| 1.15.x | YES | [proxy_connect_rewrite_1015.patch](patch/proxy_connect_rewrite_1015.patch) |

This module disables nginx REWRITE phase for CONNECT request by default, which means `if`, `set`, `rewrite_by_lua` and other REWRITE phase directives cannot be used. To enable these, you should use `proxy_connect_rewrite.patch` instead of `proxy_connect.patch`. (`TODO`: merge two patches into one.)

* Install this module from Nginx source:

```
$ wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.9.2.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf nginx-1.9.2.tar.gz
$ cd nginx-1.9.2/
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module/patch/proxy_connect.patch
$ ./configure --add-module=/path/to/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module
$ make && make install
```

* Install this module from OpenResty source:

```
$ wget https://openresty.org/download/openresty-1.13.6.2.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf openresty-1.13.6.2.tar.gz
$ cd openresty-1.13.6.2
$ ./configure --add-module=/path/to/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module
$ patch -d build/nginx-1.13.6/ -p 1 < /path/to/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module/patch/proxy_connect.patch
$ make && make install
```

Directive
=========

proxy_connect
-------------

Syntax: **proxy_connect**  
Default: `none`  
Context: `server`  

Enable "CONNECT" HTTP method support.

proxy_connect_allow
-------------------

Syntax: **proxy_connect_allow `all | [port ...] | [port-range ...]`**  
Default: `443 563`  
Context: `server`  

This directive specifies a list of port numbers or ranges to which the proxy CONNECT method may connect.  
By default, only the default https port (443) and the default snews port (563) are enabled.  
Using this directive will override this default and allow connections to the listed ports only.

The value `all` will allow all ports to proxy.

The value `port` will allow specified port to proxy.

The value `port-range` will allow specified range of port to proxy, for example:

```
proxy_connect_allow 1000-2000 3000-4000; # allow range of port from 1000 to 2000, from 3000 to 4000.
```

proxy_connect_connect_timeout
-----------------------------

Syntax: **proxy_connect_connect_timeout `time`**  
Default: `none`  
Context: `server`  

Defines a timeout for establishing a connection with a proxied server.


proxy_connect_read_timeout
--------------------------

Syntax: **proxy_connect_read_timeout `time`**  
Default: `60s`  
Context: `server`  

Defines a timeout for reading a response from the proxied server.  
The timeout is set only between two successive read operations, not for the transmission of the whole response.  
If the proxied server does not transmit anything within this time, the connection is closed.

proxy_connect_write_timeout
---------------------------

Syntax: **proxy_connect_write_timeout `time`**  
Default: `60s`  
Context: `server`  

Sets a timeout for transmitting a request to the proxied server.  
The timeout is set only between two successive write operations, not for the transmission of the whole request.  
If the proxied server does not receive anything within this time, the connection is closed.

proxy_connect_address
---------------------

Syntax: **proxy_connect_address `address | off`**  
Default: `none`  
Context: `server`  

Specifiy an IP address of the proxied server. The address can contain variables.  
The special value off is equal to none, which uses the IP address resolved from host name of CONNECT request line.  

NOTE: If using `set $<nginx variable>` and `proxy_connect_address $<nginx variable>` together, you should use `proxy_connect_rewrite.patch` instead, see [Install](#install) for more details.

proxy_connect_bind
------------------

Syntax: **proxy_connect_bind `address [transparent] | off`**  
Default: `none`  
Context: `server`  

Makes outgoing connections to a proxied server originate from the specified local IP address with an optional port.  
Parameter value can contain variables. The special value off is equal to none, which allows the system to auto-assign the local IP address and port.

The transparent parameter allows outgoing connections to a proxied server originate from a non-local IP address, for example, from a real IP address of a client:

```
proxy_connect_bind $remote_addr transparent;

```

In order for this parameter to work, it is usually necessary to run nginx worker processes with the [superuser](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#user) privileges. On Linux it is not required (1.13.8) as if the transparent parameter is specified, worker processes inherit the CAP_NET_RAW capability from the master process. It is also necessary to configure kernel routing table to intercept network traffic from the proxied server.

NOTE: If using `set $<nginx variable>` and `proxy_connect_bind $<nginx variable>` together, you should use `proxy_connect_rewrite.patch` instead, see [Install](#install) for more details.

Variables
=========

$connect_host
-------------

host name from CONNECT request line.

$connect_port
-------------

port from CONNECT request line.

$connect_addr
-------------

IP address and port of the remote host, e.g. "192.168.1.5:12345".
IP address is resolved from host name of CONNECT request line.
